Note that SATURATION is different from subarray mode in that the SATURATION window moves in accordance with position demands from TCS in the same way as ODGW. It can be used to protect against saturation caused by a bright object that is not fixed to the Imager field (i.e. a bright celestrial object during non-sidereal tracking and a non-sidereal celestrial object during sidereal tracking). When the bright object is fixed to the Imager field, an observer may use subarray mode, which has more advantage bececause it supports multiple windows.
