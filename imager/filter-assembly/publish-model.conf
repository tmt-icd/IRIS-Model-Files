Smoothing factor of trapezoidal profile for homing. See 'Motion Smoothing' chapter in [the manual of DMC-40x0](http://www.galilmotioncontrol.com/download/manual/man_40x0.pdf) for more details. The argument of KS command corresponds to this factor. 0.25 means no smoothing, and 64 means the maximum smoothing.

__TODO__: Check if the type should be integer or float. According to [the manual of DMC-40x0](http://www.galilmotioncontrol.com/download/manual/man_40x0.pdf), this value is 'an integer from 0.25 to 64 and represents the amount of smoothing', but 0.25 is not an integer...

__TODO__: Check if KS option is respected for Finding Edge motion.

__TBD__: Maybe it would be useful to map this value to the range between 0 to 1 for simplicity.

Indicates a misstep of one (ore more) of the stepper motors.

The actual scheme to detect missteps is TBD.

It is currently planned that this assembly checks the statuses of all switches in the filter wheel when “select” command is completed, and raises this alarm when the switch statuses are not the same as the expected. It might be also possible to detect misstep by checking the torque value reported by Galil motion controller, but it is not sure if it is really feasible because we currently don’t know how Galil motion controller actually measures that.

When this alarm happens, the operator is expected to acknowledges this alarm and perform “datum” again. If this alarm is repeated many times, it indicates severe damage of the mechanisms and the observer is expected to report this problem to an instrument specialist.
