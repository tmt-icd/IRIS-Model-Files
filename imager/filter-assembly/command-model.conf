Commands which can be accepted by IRIS Filter Assembly.

This command model is designed based on [Software Design Patterns for Device and Component Controllers (TMT.INS.TEC.16.079.DRF01)](https://docushare.tmt.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-57492/cc_design_patterns_DRF01_b.docx). As proposed by the design pattern, standard assembly commands and assembly-specific commands are provided for each functional group. All commands are classified into either 'request' or 'submit' based on the command type defintion described in the design pattern document.

This command changes filters. Actual behavior of this command depends on the current status and the requested filter. Typically, this command first inserts a blank plate in the bottom-most filter wheel which is closest to the detectors. Then, other 4 filter wheels are rotated to the specified position. Finally, the bottom-most filter wheel is rotated to a through hole position to remove the blank plate. If a filter in the bottom-most filter wheel is specified, two narrow band filters are inserted instead of the blank plate ( __TBC__ ). The actual behavior is determined to minimize the persistence on the detectors.
