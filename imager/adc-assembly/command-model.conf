This command causes PRISM functional group to initialize its variables, read configuration, and verify dependencies.

It may also initialize per-axis configuration of the underlying Galil HCD.

This command can be invoked only when none of the rotary stages is in motion. All commands will be rejected during the initialization. 

Initialization can fail for various reasons including HCD communications failure, hardware failure, or invalid configurations.  In this case, the command state will report an error.
