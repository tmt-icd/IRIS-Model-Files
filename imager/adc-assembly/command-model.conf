Commands which can be accepted by IRIS Science ADC Assembly.

This command model is designed based on [Software Design Patterns for Device and Component Controllers (TMT.INS.TEC.16.079.DRF01)](https://docushare.tmt.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-57492/cc_design_patterns_DRF01_b.docx). As proposed by the design pattern, standard assembly commands and assembly-specific commands are provided for each functional group. All commands are classified into either 'request' or 'submit' based on the command type defintion described in the design pattern document.

This command causes PRISM functional group to initialize its variables, read configuration, and verify dependencies.  It prepares this functional group internally such that it is available to communicate with outside processes and begin managing the stages.  It does not cause any movement or initiate any action on the hardware but, it may validate connections and hardware presence before completing.  It may also initialize per-axis configuration of the underlying Galil HCD.

This command can be invoked only when none of the rotary stages is in motion. All commands will be rejected during the initialization. 

Initialization can fail for various reasons including HCD communications failure, hardware failure, or invalid configurations.  In this case, the command state will report an error.
