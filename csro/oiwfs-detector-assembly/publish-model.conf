      The xy attribute provides the current locations of the three readout window centers in the native FCRS<sub>IRIS-POA<em>i</em></sub> (<em>i</em>=1,2,3) rotated coordinate system of each detector, in mm. Depending on the trackingType these will either be 0,0 (probe-tracking modes) or non-zero (on-chip modes).

      The xy_IRISROT attribute provides the window locations in the FCRS<sub>IRIS-ROT</sub> coordinate system (common to all of the components within IRIS), and may be offset from xy_PROBE_IRISROT (described below), depending on the trackingType (on-chip modes move the readout windows while the probes are held stationary).

      The xy_PROBE_IRISROT attribute provides the current locations of the OIWFS probes in FCRS<sub>IRIS-ROT</sub>. Normally this should match the current values published by the POA assembly, iris.oiwfs.poa.POS_current, but may reflect overriden values as specified to the tracking_override command for testing purposes, and reflected in the published trackingOverrides event.

      The detectorRotationAngle attribute gives the orientation of each detector coordinate system with respect to the IRIS rotated coordinate system. A positive value is defined as a counter-clockwise rotation from the +Y axis of FCRS<sub>IRIS-ROT</sub> to the +Y axis of FCRS<sub>IRIS-POA<em>i</em></sub> (<em>i</em>=1,2,3) when looking down into IRIS from NFIRAOS, for the probe in question.
