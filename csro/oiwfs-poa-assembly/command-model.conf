The following behaviour is configured separately in regards to how it interprets natural guide star positions provided by the TCS (through the tcsOffset parameter), and offsets provided by the NFIRAOS RTC (through the rtcOffset parameter).

<ul>
<li> <b>ON</b> activates following behaviour
<li> <b>OFF</b> de-activates following behaviour
<li> <b>NOOP</b> leaves the behaviour unchanged from its existing configuration.
</ul>

While following the assembly subscribes to the aosq.iris.oiwfs.active event stream to determine which probes are currently active. Active probes will not be affected by probes that are moving to new targets, and probes that are moving to new targets will navigate around probes that are currently active. Until the first event is received, it is assumed that no probes are active.

Any static offsets specified by the POS_offset command are added to the continually varying positions from the TCS (e.g., to account for guide star catalog position errors).

If NFIRAOS RTC offsets are being used they are provided by the nfiraos.rtc.oiwfsPoa event.

If either tcsOffset or rtcOffset are unspecified, it implies NOOP (do not change the current behaviour).

The POA stages associated with probe motion must be datumed otherwise this command will be rejected.

<em>
Discussion: OIWFS probe offsets can be offloaded from the NRTC to support several potential use cases:
</em>
<ul>
<li><em> TT is determined entirely from the ODGWs, in which case any residual errors reflect drifts in the OIWFS probe positions with respect to the IRIS Imager.</em>
<li><em> Offloading can be used to position probes directly (e.g., over calibration sources within NFIRAOS) without requiring the TCS.</em>
<li><em> While performing closed-loop dithering, self-guiding the probes using offloading can potentially prevent the NFIRAOS TT stage from saturating in the event that the error in TCS demands (the complement of motions in the telescope mount) are too large.</em>

The POS_trackingType command will set the tracking/dithering type for the OIWFS probes at a specified future time. This command has no effect on any probe that has been set to OFF with the MODE_select command.

Each probe may be in one of the following tracking modes:

<ul>
<li> <b>TRACK_POA</b>: Tracking using POA
<li> <b>TRACK_ON_CHIP</b>: Tracking using on-chip sub window offset with POA locked
<li> <b>DITHER_POA</b>: Dithering using POA
<li> <b>DITHER_ON_CHIP</b>: Dithering using on-chip sub window offset with POA locked
<li> <b>NOOP</b>: Leave the trackingType unchanged from its previous value
</ul>

The difference between TRACK and DITHER is that no science exposure is happening during DITHER and therefore relaxed accuracy is allowed (i.e., different regions of the guide and acquisition table are used for detector readouts). This mode is only meaningful after executing the POS_follow command. The *_ON_CHIP variants indicate that the probes are stationary while the readout windows move, while the remaining variants involve motion of the probes.

An optional timestamp can be provided to specify when in the future the command should take effect.

The behaviour of any unspecified command argument will remain unchanged from its previously commanded behavior.
