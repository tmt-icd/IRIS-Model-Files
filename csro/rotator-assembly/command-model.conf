When the tcs attribute is true, the rotator follows the instrumentRotatorAngle published by the tcs. If the attribute is set to false (or ommitted), it will not follow the TCS.

When the rtcOffset attribute is true, a continuously-varying angular error stream published by the NRTC (inst, based on OIWFS measurements) is applied.
