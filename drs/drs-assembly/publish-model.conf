This is the command handling state which can be:
+       UNITITIALIZED: the assembly is not properly initialized. Generally the only command that will be accepted in the state is [GROUP_]init.
+       READY: the assembly is ready to accept commands and is not processing / executing a command, and any 'following' background operations are not active.
+       BUSY: the assembly is currently processing / executing a command (any command). Generally only some commands will be accepted while in this state.
+       CONTINUOUS: The assembly has accepted a continuous-type (follow) command and the assembly is currently still in the continuous mode (i.e. taking continuous action or periodic action, e.g. follow mode or tracking). This state is somewhere between ready and busy. Generally only some commands will be accepted while in this state.
