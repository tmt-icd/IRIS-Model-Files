This command resets this assembly without cycling the power of the motion controller. During the command execution, the configuration will be reloaded and the connections to HCDs are reestablished. Successful execution will result in Init:Running state.

This command can be invoked only when all the axes are stopped. If someone wants to reset this assembly during a motion, 'stop' command has to be executed explicitly beforehand.

Internally, this command will execute SHUTDOWN, UNINITIALIZE, INITIALIZE and STARTUP commands sequentially.

This command triggers datuming. It can be invoked only when this assembly is in either Init:Running, Lock:Locked, Lock:Paused, Park:Parked, Park:Paused, Datum:Paused or Normal:Stopped state. Right after accepting this command, this assembly will go to Datum:Datuming state and stay there until datuming is completed, canceled or stopped due to an error.

Successful execution will result in Normal:Ready.

__TBD__: This command is also used to unlock and index the machanisms after cooling or pressurizing is completed. Unlock and index mechanisms should be done in 'Activate' and 'Warm Active' use cases as defined in [IRIS - Software Design Document (TMT.INS.PDD.14.024.DRF07)](https://docushare.tmt.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-32613/160210_IRIS_SDD_DRF07.docx). This command does unlock and index actions at once. To prevent from moving the axes from moving by mistake, this command will not be accepted if the dewer is not in either Activate or Warm Activate stage.

Failed execution (e.g. homing switch cannot be found, network disconnection) will result in Datum:Error state.

This command is accepted when all axes are stopped (Init:Running, In:Ready, Datum:Paused, Lock:Paused, Normal:Ready and Park:Parked). Successful execution will result in Lock:Locked state.

__TBD__: Actual actions to be taken is TBD.
