 * If necessary, download the FPGA code to the detector controller when INIT is called.
 * Consider which configuration parameters to be set at initialization, and which to be set online in response to a configuration command.
  - I believe most of them can be configured at initialization (e.g. detector gain, number of channels)


 * load_configuration needs to have an argument
   - not to generate readout files for PV mode.
   - to specify the FITS files storage location (local disk for PV mode, NFS area for Imager/IFS detector)
